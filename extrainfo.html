    <h1 id="title">Extra Info</h1>
    <h2>This website is based on a in universe company called "The Tower Co." from the upcoming project from Studio Rift nicknamed "Project TCG". </h2>
    <p>Studio Rift is a small indie studio from Indiana that is really just 3 guys that are kinda bored.</p>
    <p>Most of our ideas where made in Discord calls late at night and we think they sound cool.</p>
    <p>Whille we have not put out any project yet, we have been working a few ideas like "Project Dark Wood", "Project TCG", and "Project R".</p>
